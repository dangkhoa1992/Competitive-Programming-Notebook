## Note: Consider multimap vs map carefully

## Consider Sorting - Grouping duplicated elements as always
Consider grouping duplicates to reduce runtime of map, priorityqueue etc...

    2 2 2 3 5
    -> [{2:3}, {3:1}, {5:1}]

- map<int, int>
- map<int, vector<>, vector<>>
- priority_queue<int, int>
