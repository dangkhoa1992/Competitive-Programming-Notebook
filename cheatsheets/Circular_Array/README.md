#### Circular array
- A circular array represented by A[i] can be duplicated to solve
- Example: A = [5,6,1,2,3] -> [5,6,1,2,3,5,6,1,2,3]

#### A wheels
- A wheel has value from [1,N] has pre-defined positions `A[1,N]` can be duplicated to solve as `A[1,N,N+1,2*N]`
- Example: `N = 10, A = [2,3,8,9]` -> `[2,3,8,9,12,13,18,19]`
